# WaveRGB

##Version 1.2

Executable available for download at http://www.jdsoftcode.net/wave-rgb.html

Contributions to localize this code are welcome. Two primary targets are `KeyboardInfo.cs` for international keyboard layouts and `RingPrefs.cs` for LGS user interface elements. My intention would be to offer localized .exe files instead of adding interface to select a region within the app.

This repository does not include the necessary Logitech LED illumination SDK. It can be downloaded here: https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/developer-lab.html. Once downloaded, it's only necessary to drop the appropriate `LogitechLedEnginesWrapper.dll` alongside the .exe.  Or just use the version included with the executable download.
